# SVG COORINATOR

Are you tired of manually typing the coordinates of the SVG elements for hours until you get the perfect result?

With SVG Coordinator, all you have to do is point and click! The coordinates will be figured out for you.

## How to use

> [!NOTE]
> Uploaded SVG files are not stored on the server. They are only used to generate the coordinates.

1. Upload the SVG file you want to edit.
2. Point and click on an area of the image.
3. Accept or reject the coordinates/position.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until you have all the coordinates you need.
5. Download the coordinates as a JSON file or copy them to the clipboard (see the web console).
